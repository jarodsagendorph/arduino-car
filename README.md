# Arduino Self-Driving Car
Arduino self-driving car that can toggle between manual control via a Blynk applet or drive itself and avoid obstacles

## Description
Final project for my [Introduction to Physical Computing](https://sites.google.com/view/cics290m) in Fall 2018. The final projects were demonstrated at a Maker Fair where the public could see and use our creations.
This is an Arduino Self-Driving Car programmed for a WeMos WiFi board. A Blynk applet can be used to connect to and control the car for
manual transmission. Blynk applet contained a joystick for manual control, button to toggle between self-driving and manual-driving modes.

## Getting Started
### Hardware Design
Hardware used for this build was:
1 WeMos board
1 Servo motor
1 Ultrasonic distance sensor
1 L298N Motor Control Board
4 Wheels and DC Motors
1 Mounting Platform 
1 Rechargable USB battery

A photo of the build is included below:

### Software Design
Software for this car is written in the Arduino IDE using a C++ library for Arduino programming and is included in this repository. Software was then flashed to the WeMos board using the IDE for proper use.

The Arduino IDE can be download [here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)
